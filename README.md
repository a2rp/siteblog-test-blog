# The First Drop

A clean, minimal test blog page for AstraRoute siteblog listing.

</div>

## What is this repo

This repo is a **siteblog** post.

Your AstraRoute app detects repos with topic **siteblog**, shows the hero image from repo root, and opens the live page inside a modal iframe.

---

## Quick checklist

- Add topic: `siteblog`
- Put `main_image.webp` in repo root
- Enable GitHub Pages (deploy from branch)
- Set the repo Homepage to the live URL

---

## Files in root

- `index.html` - the blog page
- `style.css` - styles for the blog page
- `main_image.webp` - hero image used on listing card
- `favicon.ico` - tab icon

---

## Live preview

After enabling GitHub Pages, your live URL will look like:

- `https://a2rp.github.io/<repo-name>/`

Set this same URL in GitHub repo settings as **Homepage**.

---

## Notes

- If iframe preview is blank inside your app modal, it is usually because the page blocks embedding.
- In that case, use the modal "Open" button to read in a new tab.
